# FUNK

'FUNK' is a script written in Bash that implements various forms of post-exploitation pillaging on CentOS and Ubuntu Linux machines. This was created as a way to automate all the shenanigans that go on when you have full-knowledge on your environment and targets. 

Currently, the devastation encompasses:
	- Attempt to open firewall (U/C)
	- Add sudo backup users
	- Ensure sudo doesnt need password
	- Set SUID bins
	- Drop prism bins
	- Establish systemd persistence
	- Timestomp and Log deletion
	- Collect valuable files and tar em' up

For educational use only. Do not use in unauthorized systems or environments. Use at your own risk. Have fun.
